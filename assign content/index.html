        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: center;">Commonly Asked Questions</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <b>1. How should I plan my assignment/essay? How to start my assignment.</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10px; position: relative; text-indent: 50px;">
            To complete your assignment efficiently and stay organized, it is important to plan it effectively. <h4 style="color: green;">Let's get started!</h4>
        <li>Carefully read the assignment instructions and understand what is expected of you. Identify the important components, like the topic, formatting guidelines, word count, and any specific instructions.</li>
        <li> Create a clear structure for your assignment by analyzing the task. Break down the assignment into smaller tasks or subtopics and identify the main ideas or arguments you need to cover.
        </li>
        <li>Set a realistic timeline for your assignment by considering your deadline and any other commitments you have. Divide your time into different stages, such as outlining, researching, writing, and editing. Make sure to allocate specific time periods for each task in order to stay on track.
        </li>
        <li>Research: Gather relevant information from credible sources. Use books, scholarly articles, reputable websites, and other academic resources. This will be followed by taking notes and organize your research material for easy reference later.
        </li>
        <li> Start your essay now. Start with an introduction that presents your topic and thesis statement.

            Then outline the main points or arguments you will discuss in the body paragraphs, and finally, plan a conclusion that summarizes your findings.
            
            Remember to cite your sources properly and maintain a consistent writing style.
            
            Revise and edit: Once you've completed the first draft, take a break before starting the revision process.
            
            Edit and proofread your assignment multiple times until you are satisfied with the final version. If possible, ask a friend, classmate, or teacher to review your assignment.
            
            Finalize your assignment: Make any necessary changes based on the feedback you received.
                    </li>
        </p>

        <b>2. How should I format my assignment/essay? What are the commonly accepted formatting guidelines for academic assignments or essays?</b>
        <p style="text-indent: 10px;">
            <li> Font and Size: Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri, with a standard size of 12 points.
            </li>
            <li> Line Spacing: Use double-spacing throughout the entire document, including the body text, block quotes, references, and any appendices.
            </li>
            <li> Alignment and Indentation: Align the text to the left margin and use a standard indentation of 0.5 inches for the first line of each paragraph.
            </li>
            <li> Title Page: Include a separate title page with the title of the assignment/essay, your name, the course title, the instructor's name, and the date. 
                However, you should consider any specific instructions provided by your institution or instructor first before embarking on these guidelines.
        </li>
        <li> Header: You are possibly wondering, how should I format the header? You should note that headings are standard for some writing forms such as case studies and reports. Additionally, 
            some writing forms such as MLA must have a header positioned on the right side. Include a header on each page of MLA assignments so that your name comes before the page number; eg. "Justin 2" 
            would appear on page two top-right. Other formats like APA 7 standard for students do not require a running head. This is contrary to APA 6 which required a running head on the left top margin.
    </li>
        </p>

        <b>3. How should I list tables in a research paper?</b> <div class="ripple-effect1"></div>
        <p style="text-indent: 10px;">
            <li> Title and Subheadings: Center the title of your assignment/essay at the top of the first page. Use appropriate subheadings to organize your content,
                if required, and ensure consistency in formatting. Always use at least two subheadings or none at all. For the next main section of the paper, regardless of whether it includes headings, use a Level 1 heading after the introduction. When it comes to subsections of Level 1 headings, make sure to use Level 2 headings. Avoid labeling headings with numbers or letters. Note that all topics of equal importance should have the same level of heading.
       </li>
       <li> Paragraphs: Indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches and use a blank line to separate paragraphs.
    </li>
    <li> Citations and References: Use a recognized citation style, such as APA, MLA, Havard or Chicago, 
        and follow its guidelines for in-text citations and the formatting of the reference list or bibliography. 
        Pay attention to rules regarding capitalization, italics, punctuation, and the order of information. 
        In APA format, follow the author-date method for in-text citations. This means that the author's surname and 
        the year of publication of the source should appear in the text, eg (Kelsha, 2021). 
        Full references to each source should appear in the reference list at the end of the paper.
</li>
<li> Page Numbers: Number all pages consecutively, typically in the header or footer section of the document.
    Use the page numbering feature of your word processing program to insert page numbers. Enter the page number in the upper right corner. Page numbers should appear on all pages.
For MLA, page numbers are placed one-half inch from the top margin and flush with the right margin.
In Harvard style, place a title on each page, which should include the title of your work and the page number
in the upper right corner. Be sure to include the title of your work, your name, the name of your institution, and the date of submission on the title page.
</li>
<li> All tables should be labeled and formatted in APA style, including the headings, borders, numbering, and short notes.
    Tables should be placed after the first paragraph where you mention about the table. 
   If a table is still large, after mentioning it, you can position it on the page that follows.

        <b>4. How should I format, and where should I position figures and tables in a research paper?</b>
        <p style="text-indent: 10px;">
            <li> Figures and tables should be placed in the middle of the page. It should be 
                properly cited and ordered by the number it appears in the text. Also, tables 
                should be separated from text. In order for the data to be clear, the images must 
                be of appropriate size and high resolution. Elements are also important when adding images tables or graphs; 
                use color, lines and symbols, but ensure they add effect and not to encoding information. 
                You should also not leave tables unnamed. They should be followed by descriptive information, including units of measure.
        </li>
